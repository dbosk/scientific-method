<p>Statistics play a vital role in security research for several reasons. <br>For example the first paper used live statics gathered by the Tor project to prove that their developed client closely matches a real network in performance. They essentially analysed patterns of the Tor networked and compared them with their developed simulation client.<br>The second paper, used statistics in their background section to quantify risk and the third paper measured the accuracy of WF classification an attacker can achieve in a real world scenario, which assessing the effectiveness of the attack. <br>There are of course many more (e.g. access risk based on history, evaluate performance, experiments to study user behaviour for something like password reuse), but I will stop at the ones found in the papers.</p>
<p>Machine learning essentially operates completely on the statistics of the data it was trained on. Therefore, all the things explained above can be done by an ML algorithm without a human having to spend time on it. However, an ML is only ever as good as the data it was trained on and also brings many other problems. Consequently, it is a useful tool but one need to be careful when using it and verify the results.</p>
