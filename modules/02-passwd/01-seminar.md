The library will come and talk about tools to use for searching and how to do 
literature reviews.

**Participation**: Online in the class Zoom room. Working webcam and microphone 
is required.

**Preparation**: The assignments that you just did (all previous material). You 
need a device that you can work with web tools on.

**Seminar content**: The library will talk about different types of literature 
reviews. They will also present some useful tools for searching for literature. 
We'll use these tools to search for literature to answer some of the research 
questions we've discussed in the preparation material. (That's why you need a 
device to work on.)
