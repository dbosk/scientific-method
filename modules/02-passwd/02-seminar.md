**Participation**: Online in the class Zoom room. Working webcam and microphone 
is required.

**Preparation**: The assignments that you just did (all previous material from 
last seminar until now).

**Seminar content**: We will discuss the papers that you've worked with.

Particularly, we'll discuss how they relate to the research questions that was 
the origin of the discussion. What we're interested in is how well these papers 
answer those research questions and, particularly, how we can answer *exactly* 
those questions.
