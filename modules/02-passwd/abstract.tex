% XXX Summary
\emph{Summary:}
In this assignment we will focus on security around password-based 
authentication.
It's an important topic, because for decades people everywhere has been very 
unscientific when it comes to the design and choice of password 
policies\autocite{Estes2017Aug}.

% XXX Prerequisites
\emph{Prerequisites:}
We need basic knowledge of security, corresponding to an introductory course in 
the subject.
We also need a high-level overview of the breadth of research methods used in 
the area of security, corresponding to the overview lecture \enquote{The 
Scientific Method} given in the course.
