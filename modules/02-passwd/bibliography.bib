              authentication. We provide a comprehensive overview of published 
              research in the area, covering both usability and security 
              aspects as well as system evaluation. The article first 
              catalogues existing approaches, highlighting novel features of 
              selected schemes and identifying key usability or security 
              advantages. We then review usability requirements for 
              knowledge-based authentication as they apply to graphical 
              passwords, identify security threats that such systems must 
              address and review known attacks, discuss methodological issues 
              related to empirical evaluation, and identify areas for further 
              research and improved methodology.},

  abstract = {To build systems shielding users from fraudulent (or phishing) 
              websites, designers need to know which attack strategies work and 
              why. This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which 
              malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. 
              We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and 
              developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might 
              work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in 
              which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to 
              determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23\% of the 
              participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the 
              address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to 
              incorrect choices 40\% of the time. We also found that some 
              visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated 
              users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators 
              are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and 
              suggest that alternative approaches are needed.},
