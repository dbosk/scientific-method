  \begin{question}[Users get routed]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What was the research question?
      \item What methods did they use?
      \item Why is that a good method?
      \item Can we use another method?

  \begin{solution}[What was the research question?]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How susceptible are \alert<2>{typical} users to attacks by 
        \alert<2>{reasonably realistic} adversaries?

  \begin{solution}[What methods did they use?]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item They used a simulation.

    \begin{question}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Why is a simulation a good method?

    \begin{itemize}
      \item What was the research question?

    \begin{itemize}
      \item They complained about the evaluation of WF in other papers.
        What was the problem?
      \item Are there any problems with this paper's approach?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{question}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}[Problems]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Didn't test WF+WO paper's approach in this new setting.
      \item Papers like WF+WO must use same approach as papers they compare 
        with.
